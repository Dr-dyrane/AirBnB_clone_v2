# AirBnB Clone - Web Framework

## Project Overview

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and serves as a hands-on introduction to web development using the Flask web framework in Python. The goal is to build a simplified version of the popular AirBnB platform, focusing on key web development concepts such as routing, templates, and database interaction.

## Project Description

In this project, we will create a web application that replicates some of the core functionalities of AirBnB. Leveraging Flask, a Python web framework, we'll develop various routes to display different pages and handle data. Additionally, we'll utilize HTML templates to render dynamic web pages and work with a MySQL database to store and retrieve information.

## Learning Objectives

By embarking on this project, you'll gain valuable insights into web development. Here are the main learning objectives:

- **Web Framework Fundamentals:** Understand the concept of a web framework and learn how to build one using Flask.
- **Routing:** Define routes in Flask to handle different URLs and requests.
- **Templates:** Create dynamic HTML responses using templates and pass data from the backend to the frontend.
- **Database Interaction:** Retrieve and display data from a MySQL database within HTML pages.
- **Code Style:** Ensure that your code adheres to the PEP 8 style guidelines for Python.
- **HTML/CSS:** Create W3C-compliant HTML and CSS code for the web pages.


## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure that you have Flask installed. You can install Flask using the following command:

```bash
$ pip3 install Flask
```

Additionally, you should have a running and properly configured MySQL database. Import the provided SQL dump to populate your database with initial data.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project's directory structure:

- **`web_flask`:** This directory contains Flask application scripts for each task.
- **`templates`:** Inside this directory, you'll find HTML templates used for rendering web pages.
- **`static`:** Contains static files such as CSS stylesheets and images.
- **`models`:** This directory contains Python classes that define data models and handle database interaction.

## Running the Project

You can execute each task by running the corresponding Python script located in the `web_flask` directory. For example, to run Task 0, use the following command:

```bash
$ python3 -m web_flask.0-hello_route
```

Remember to request a manual QA review upon completion of the project.
